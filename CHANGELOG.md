## [Unreleased]

### Added

- M0, repository scaffold and CI gates:
  - Cargo workspace (edition 2024, Rust 1.99.0, workspace lints) with the
    `kage` binary and eight library crates. `kage serve` exposes `/healthz`;
    `kage healthcheck` probes it for the container healthcheck.
  - Sidecar pnpm workspace (TypeScript strict, ESM) with the `contract`,
    `engine-core`, `engine-chromium`, `engine-firefox` and `server` packages.
    The server exposes `/v1/health`; the `ENGINE` variable selects the engine
    package; both engines are stubs.
  - `justfile` with every dev and CI command; `just ci` runs everything a
    pull request runs.
  - Dockerfiles for `kage` and both sidecar variants, and a compose file with
    Postgres 17, healthchecks and hardened containers.
  - GitHub Actions: `ci.yaml`, `nightly-live.yaml` (skeleton) and
    `release.yaml`.
  - Supply-chain gates: cargo-deny, cargo-audit, pnpm audit, a license policy
    for the sidecar, gitleaks, Trivy, CycloneDX SBOMs, and a check that fails
    when `openssl-sys` is in the Rust dependency graph.
  - Coverage gate: at least 80 % line coverage on `kage-core`, `kage-proxy`,
    `kage-crawl`, `kage-extract` and `engine-core`.
  - README with a responsible-use section, dual MIT / Apache-2.0 license
    files, CODEOWNERS and the repository runbook.
  - Exact dependency pins re-verified and recorded in `docs/versions.md`.
  - ADR 0008 (proposed): AGPL-licensed `ua-parser-js` in the Firefox engine
    dependency tree.
